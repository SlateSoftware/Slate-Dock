# Slate Dock
This repository will contain the files for the **Dock** of the Slate Desktop One desktop environment.
Keep in mind we're still working on the whole project.

## How to install 
You can install **latte-dock** by running the `install.sh` script. Remember to make the file executable:

```bash
sudo chmod a+x install.sh
```

Then you can run it.
Make sure it is in the same folder as the `latte/` directory
