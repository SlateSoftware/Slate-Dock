# Slate Dock
This repository will contain the files for the **Dock** of the Slate Desktop One desktop environment.
Keep in mind we're still working on the whole project.

## How to install 
You can momentarily install **latte-dock** and import the [latte/Slate_Desktop_Dock.layout.latte](latte/Slate_Desktop_Dock.layout.latte) file into the layout manager (inside of Latte's configuration menu).
I'm working on a bash script to automate the process.
